This project is about weather dashboard.
I used Bootstrap, JQuery, MOmement, and the openweather API to retrieve weather data for cities.
It will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
It displays the following under current weather condition in : City, date, Icon img, UV index, wind speed, humidity
It incldues search history so users can acess thier past search terms.
It includes 5 day forecast below the current weather conditions.

This project/homework was in pain.
